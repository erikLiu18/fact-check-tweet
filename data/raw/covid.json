CONCLUSION: INACCURATE (\u201cAccurate\u201d in a previous version of this article - see note below) based on a misinterpretation of data. Data published by the UK Health Security Agency at the time of the claim suggested that with two doses, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation due to Omicron was 52%. However, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is not a measure of hospitalisation rates, it is a measure of how much vaccination reduces the chance that someone will need hospital, compared with having taken no vaccine at all. The data at the time said that, if you\u2019ve had two vaccine doses but no booster, you would be 52% less likely to require hospital due to Omicron compared with if you caught that variant and were unvaccinated.",
